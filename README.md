# UK DOG LOVERS PLS READ!
If you live in West Yorkshire (or are willing to drive there) and are looking to adopt a dog, please check out West Yorkshire Greyhound Trust (link in profile)! They have lots of greyhounds waiting for homes, and will try to match you with the greyhound that best suits your needs. They are mostly ex-racing greyhounds aged 3+, however some younger ones were given up before their career had started. 

Greyhounds are sighthounds, which means they have LOOOOOONG snouts, and the internet seems to love those. While they aren't quite on Borzoi level, they come in close second!

Although they have been used for racing, greyhounds are not that high-energy. They are built for speed, not endurance. They love the couch, LOVE sleeping, and love a cuddle. But this isn't to say they don't need exercise - they need at least 30 minutes exercise per day, but ideally a daily and nightly walk. If it's secure and has enough space, you can also let them run around off-lead in your garden.

Greyhounds are large dogs (26-40kg / 57-88lbs), which is something to consider. They will have more expensive vet bills and food, so if you cannot afford please do not feel obligated to home one. On the flip side, as they are shorthaired dogs, they require minimal grooming so grooming costs go down exponentially. They do still need to be bathed and brushed every once in a while though. (bathed once every 3 months, with the exception of them rolling in mud or something of course)

Unfortunately, they are currently unable to cat test the greyhounds, so if you own cats you cannot home one of them.

If you are interested and are able to home a greyhound, please do visit their website!
